# VariantDiscoveryPipeline
A pipeline I developed to discover variants (SNPS and INDELS) using TCGA protected data.  It uses PICARD, GATK and AtlasSNP2.  Currently it is just a bash script.  All the aligned bam files need to be downloaded and stored in an accessible location.  See the script for folders that need to be created.  This is very much a work in progress at the moment.
